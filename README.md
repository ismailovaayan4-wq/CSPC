# CSPC - Computer Science for Physics and Chemistry
My coursework repository. Each practical is under PW<n>/Lab <X>/.

## Setup
Create the environment for a given lab:
conda env create -f PW<n>/Lab\ <X>/environment.yml
conda activate cspc

## PW1 - Lab A: Reproducible Foundations

**What I built:**
- A CSPC repository with Git version control, a conda environment, a radioactive decay
  simulation, and automated tests comparing a pure-Python loop to a vectorised NumPy version.

**Speed comparison (loop vs NumPy):**
- loop : 1.6680 s
- numpy : 0.0002 s
- speed-up: 7344.8x faster

**Tests:** all passing? yes

**Conclusion:**
- The NumPy vectorised version was dramatically faster than the pure-Python loop because it
  processes all atoms in the sample at once instead of looping over each one individually in
  Python. All three tests pass, confirming the simulation starts at N0, correctly rejects a
  negative decay rate, and matches the analytical exponential decay law on average.
